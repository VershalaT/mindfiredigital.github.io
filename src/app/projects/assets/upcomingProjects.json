    "Summary": "This script simplifies the deployment process for developers by abstracting the complexities of Kubernetes. By providing the necessary configuration in the config.yaml file, developers can quickly deploy their applications to a Kubernetes cluster with ease without the need for in-depth Kubernetes knowledge. It also supports starting and stopping services, along with options for development (dev) and production (prod) modes. The config.yaml is intended for individual microservices. It aims to enhance the efficiency of deploying and scaling microservices by providing a flexible and customizable solution.",
